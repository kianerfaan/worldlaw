<section id="terms">
    <p>By using WorldLaw AI, you agree to follow these terms. If you don’t agree, stop using the service. You must use our services lawfully and responsibly. Breaches can lead to termination or other legal actions. You may need an account to access some features, and you're responsible for keeping your credentials secure. If you suspect misuse, contact us immediately.</p>

    <p>Do not engage in illegal, harmful, or disruptive activities on our platform. Intellectual property, including all site content, belongs to us or our partners. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Services are provided "as-is" without guarantees, and we are not liable for issues you may encounter. In case of disputes, we prefer arbitration over court. Arbitration will take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, unless we agree otherwise.</p>

    <p>We may link to third-party services, but we aren’t responsible for them. We can terminate your access without warning. If your dispute isn't resolved through arbitration, it will follow Pennsylvania law. These terms might change, and by continuing to use the service, you agree to new terms.</p>

    <p>If something beyond our control happens, like internet outages or natural disasters, we aren’t responsible. These terms, along with our privacy policy, represent our entire agreement. If a part of these terms becomes invalid, the rest still apply.</p>

    <p>If you have questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@worldlaw.ai">contact@worldlaw.ai</a>. Our office address is WorldLaw LLC, c/o Northwest Registered Agent LLC, 502 W 7th St, Ste 100, Erie, PA 16502.</p>
