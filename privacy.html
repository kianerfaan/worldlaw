    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. We collect only what we need, including contact details, usage data, and communications you send us. We use this information to provide services, improve our platform, ensure security, and respond to your inquiries. We may also analyze usage to improve your experience.</p>

    <p>We do not sell your data. It may be shared with trusted providers or disclosed if required by law. If our business changes, such as through a merger, data may transfer as part of that process. When transferring data internationally, we follow applicable laws, including GDPR safeguards.</p>

    <p>You have the right to access your data, correct inaccuracies, request deletion where legally possible, or object to certain uses. If you gave consent before, you can also withdraw it.</p>

    <p>Your data is protected with industry-standard security measures. Although no system is perfect, we work to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. We use cookies to enhance your experience, and you can manage them through your browser settings.</p>
